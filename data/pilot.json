Maybe not clear enough I'm not sure , letter just says he wants more views, guess I'm wondering if anyone else has had the same , my appointment with rheumatology is still going ahead before the mri scan so I guess he can maybe fill me in , but at this point I'm going to assume either pictures not good enough or something showed up and they need a better angle maybe , so frustrating, thanks for reading",

Not directly relevant.\n\nSnippet 6: Mentions metronidazole in the context of a case of fulminant rosacea-like eruption, but does not provide information on the effectiveness of oral metronidazole for stage 1 rosacea. Not directly relevant.\n\nSnippet 7: Mentions a combination of oral modified-release doxycycline and metronidazole 1% gel as an effective treatment for rosacea.
